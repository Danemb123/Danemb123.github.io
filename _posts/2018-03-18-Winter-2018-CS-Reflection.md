Creating the Foundation for Efficiency

Reflection Questions:

1.	When you first signed up for this class, what goals did you have for this class? What did you hope to learn or get out of it?
	
	When signing up for this class, I was intending to expand my horizons passed business. Taking many business classes can feel overwhelmingly dry and uninteresting. I thought that taking this class would have be fun and beneficial to my then understanding of computers. I wanted to improve my existing knowledge of MS Excel and to learn something completely new. This class met expectations. I was able to learn about sorting data and use formulas reference data from other sheets. It was more challenging than I thought it would be but I’m glad I put in the work. I definitely payed off in my business class as I was immediately able to using that knowledge in an analysis class. And additionally, this class pushed me to learn programming languages I never knew existed.  

2.	Did your goals change at all over the quarter, or did new goals emerge? If so, how and why did these goals change?
	
	My goals definitely changed toward the end, especially with this website project. At first I just wanted to get the project over with because of the other finals I’ve dealt with, but now that I’ve taken a breather and given this project a chance, I see the value in learning so much more than what is required. The ability to code for HTML or other web browsers is not only useful academically but is useful occupationally, especially when you’re in the stages of looking for a new job.  Toward the end of this term, I went from wanting to learn something new and improving MS Excel skills to wanting to create my own program using Python and create different websites using HTML. 
	
3.	How successful were you at achieving your goals? Why were you successful to this degree? What would have made you more successful?

	Understanding Python was a big step. It took me hours to get comfortable with the syntax of a programming language because other than Micro:bits, it was my first time writing code of any type. Micro:bits was a nice introduction to programming but it also felt limiting. I’m glad we moved on from that to Python because at some point for me, it became frustrating. When it comes to my original goals, I was very successful. I learned more on MS Excel and learned more than I thought I would.  

4.	What was your most significant accomplishment in this class? Why was this accomplishment significant?

	The accomplishment that I’m most proud of is my MS Excel project analyzing rain data. I was able to create a formula that reference data from another sheet and using the “AVERAGEIFS” function to drag down and create results. It was significant because it was exactly what I was wanting to get out of this class and I was able to understand on a higher level what MS Excel is capable of.   

5.	What was the most valuable assignment or topic in this class for you? Why?

	The most valuable assignment I felt this class had to offer was the end of the term website project. I understand the efficacy of being able to build a website and being able to sell this skill for cash or for a job position. I know my skills are not refined enough now but I have the foundation to ask the right questions and to continue to develop these skills after this class has finished. So I believe the final project is most valuable as it teaches you to find problems and solutions on your own, which is something we do in business quite a bit.  
	
6.	What assignment or topic did you enjoy the most? Why?

	My favorite assignment was the Python III turtle assignment. It was exciting to see how a language I had just became familiar with could create such striking visuals using simple “if” rules. I did more research and learned you can create games using the Turtle. While that may have been fun, it would have been very time consuming. Still, I liked seeing what the turtle was capable of and how I was able to create a Mobius-strip-like function.  At first, drawing a line forward and left or right seemed too simple to create something visually striking but I was quickly mistaken when I learned that the creativity was all in the logic of the coding. 

7.	What assignment or topic was the most challenging? Why?

	The website and the Micro:bits were challenging. I ran into lots of challenges with Micro:bits trying to create a snowing dot game. Perhaps I had misunderstood or overcomplicated the directions but it was difficult for me to understand in comparison to Python. Building a website also feels very difficult but I have not become frustrated with it, rather I’ve become ambitious in asking questions of things I want and don’t understand. It is difficult because the code doesn’t feel as organized and the repository is strange in that codes are written in several places. Still I feel compelled to continue building this website even after I’m finished with this class.

8.	What grade would you give yourself for this class, and how would you justify that grade? Are you satisfied with your performance and work in the class? Why or why not?

	I know I missed class but considering the hours I put into my work outside of class for the reading responses, learning programing languages, asking questions, and going to office hours, I think I still deserve an A- to an A. I learned far more than I thought I would so I am definitely satisfied with my performance. I also didn’t take this class for the sake of a grade but I took it for sake of learning valuable information. I wanted to learn what was taught, and teach myself what I didn’t understand. The only complaint I have is that the school did not give Ellie a better classroom to teach this class in. I would have been able to keep up better had there been power outlets and larger tables. I may have been more satisfied with my own performance had there been a more suitable class to work in. (And this class and professor definitely deserves a better classroom)
